We are going to add a web based world builder into the evennia django app.

What I would like to do is be able to drag and drop rooms and connect them with exits.
I should be able to set descriptions, attributes, tags on the room. 
I should be able to save and reload the design.
I should be able to export the design to use a python batch script to actually build the design.
