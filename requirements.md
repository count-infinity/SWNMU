# Requirements Checklist for User Story Implementation

## User Story
1. The user walks into a room that is "dark" so they can't see anything by default.
   - The room will just look like "It's too dark to see"
2. The user has night vision goggles that they have equipped on their head. The 'use goggles' to turn them on. When they now "look", the room description shows in green.
3. There is a "Thug" NPC in the room.
4. The user uses the skill "intimidate" that rolls against charisma stat.
5. On success the Thug will then become my unwilling follower.
6. User then "order thug airlock" where the thug goes out an airlock exit.
7. User "press red button" which will open the airlock, which sends all the contents included "Thug" out into space.
8. The thug will eventually die because they aren't able to breathe in the environment.

## 1. Room Visibility/Lighting System
- **1.1** Room property for darkness/lighting state
- **1.2** Modified `return_appearance()` to check lighting conditions
- **1.3** Override look command to respect visibility
- **1.4** Integration with equipment that provides vision
- **1.5** Color-coded descriptions based on vision type (green for night vision)

## 2. Equipment System
- **2.1** Wearable item slots (head, body, etc.)
- **2.2** Equipment state tracking (on/off for devices)
- **2.3** `use` command for activating equipment
- **2.4** Equipment behaviors that modify perception/abilities
- **2.5** Night vision goggles object with activation mechanics

## 3. Skill Check System
- **3.1** Skill check mechanics with stat modifiers
- **3.2** Opposed skill checks (intimidate vs willpower/morale)
- **3.3** Success/failure result handling
- **3.4** Integration with existing skill system
- **3.5** Random number generation for dice rolls

## 4. NPC Behavior System
- **4.1** NPC base class with behavioral states
- **4.2** Intimidation response behavior
- **4.3** Follower behavior (following player movement)
- **4.4** State management (neutral → intimidated → follower)
- **4.5** NPC reactions to skill use events

## 5. Command/Order System
- **5.1** `order` command for giving instructions to followers
- **5.2** Follower command interpretation
- **5.3** Movement commands for NPCs
- **5.4** Validation of follower status before accepting orders

## 6. Environmental System
- **6.1** Room environment types (normal, vacuum, toxic, etc.)
- **6.2** Breathing requirements for characters/NPCs
- **6.3** Environmental damage over time
- **6.4** Life support equipment integration
- **6.5** Death from environmental exposure

## 7. Airlock Mechanics
- **7.1** Airlock room type with special behaviors
- **7.2** Controllable objects (red button)
- **7.3** `press` command for interacting with controls
- **7.4** Airlock cycling mechanics (contents ejection)
- **7.5** Integration with exit system

## 8. Death/Damage System
- **8.1** Health/condition tracking for NPCs and players
- **8.2** Environmental damage application
- **8.3** Death state and handling
- **8.4** Cleanup of dead NPCs
- **8.5** Death messages and notifications

## 9. Integration Requirements
- **9.1** Event system integration for all interactions
- **9.2** Behavior system for object responses
- **9.3** Consistent use of handler patterns
- **9.4** Proper state persistence across server restarts
- **9.5** Error handling and edge cases

## 10. Commands to Implement/Modify
- **10.1** `look` - Modified to respect lighting
- **10.2** `use` - For activating equipment
- **10.3** `intimidate` - Skill-based command
- **10.4** `order` - Command followers
- **10.5** `press` - Interact with controls

## 11. Testing Framework
- **11.1** Unit tests for each system component
- **11.2** E2E test script for complete user story
- **11.3** Automated test runner with setup/cleanup
- **11.4** Test commands for in-game execution
- **11.5** Mock objects and fixtures for isolated testing
- **11.6** Performance and stress testing
- **11.7** Test data validation and reporting

## Implementation Priority
1. **High Priority**: Lighting system, equipment system, skill checks, NPC behaviors
2. **Medium Priority**: Command system, airlock mechanics, death system
3. **Testing**: Comprehensive test framework for validation
4. **Integration**: Event system ties everything together

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Individual system components (`world/test_user_story.py`)
- **E2E Tests**: Complete scenario automation (`world/e2e_test_runner.py`)
- **Test Commands**: In-game test execution (`commands/test_commands.py`)
- **Manual Testing**: Test object setup for manual verification

This comprehensive checklist covers all the systems needed to support the complex user story while maintaining the extensible framework approach with full test coverage.
